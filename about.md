### Hey, my name is Jeremiah Onwubuya and Iâ€™m a chef, artist, musician, engineer, and polyglot just trying to spread good ideas. 

### I'm currently a student at [Rochester Institute of Technology](http://www.rit.edu), where I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering. I'm a member of [RIT SPEX](http://sites.sg.rit.edu/spex/), [RIT Formula SAE](http://www.rit.edu/kgcoe/formula/), and [RIT EVT](http://evt.rit.edu)
