### I’m lost in the night

### I’ve been stuck there forever

### Seeing all of these faces

### And with none that I can remember

### I’ll keep my issues to myself

### And try to survive without any help

### Because this feeling of sorrow is one I can’t escape

### I’ll put my head high and surrender to my fate
