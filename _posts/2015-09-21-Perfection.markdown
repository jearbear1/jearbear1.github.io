![Perfection](/pimages/strive-for-progress-not-perfection-257x300.png)

### When you look at this situation, you say that it’s my fault.

### So from now on, I’ll take your words with a grain of salt.

### Everyone has bad days and everyone makes mistakes.

### So I’ll just do my best and try to grow,

### Because I’m the furthest thing from perfect,

### Like everyone I know.
