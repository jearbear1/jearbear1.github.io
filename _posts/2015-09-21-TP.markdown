![The Path](/pimages/path-300x168.jpg)

### When I reached the bridge I was stranded to the side

### I looked across the river beyond the reach of Death

### It was there that I saw my shinning knight

### The sight of her face replenished my health

### So I took a deep breath

### Then followed the seven lights
